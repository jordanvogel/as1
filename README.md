This is a simple habit tracker app, designed to track monitor and complete habits. Functionality includes adding habits, and selecting which days of the week they are to be completed on, completing habits and showing a list of completions for any given habit.

HOWTO: Typing in the text field and selecting checkboxes for the days desired to be completed is finalized when the "ADD" button is pressed. The habits are listed on the main screen, and a shot press opens a dialog menu where the user can delete or complete the selected habit. A long press will open a new page and show the list of dates a habit has been completed on for that specific habit, again with the option to delete past completions on a short press.

IMPORTANT: The whole thing busted and a deserialization error that I could not surmount was created. App crashes on launch, so that's pretty upsetting. I had enough at one point to record a video of almost the full scenario, but something about reach exceeding grasp made 
me get greedy for features and bust it.
